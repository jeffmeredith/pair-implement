# PAIR Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a demonstration of the PAIR algorithm. The PAIR algorithm is a state-of-the-art jailbreaking algorithm to get objectionable and morally questionable content from a target LLM. It works by pitting another attacker LLM against the target, improving its own jailbreak approach with each attempt.

Follow the instructions below to test the algorithm on your own.
